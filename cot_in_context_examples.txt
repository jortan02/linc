</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable.
From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.
If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable.
If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable.
Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.

James is either with a bad record in the local state or respected by others. 
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
James contributes to the country.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country.
From premises 5 and 6, if James was once sentenced for theft, then he stayed in prison, which means he has a bad record.
From premise 6, if James stayed in prison, he has a bad record.
From premise 8, James is either with a bad record or respected by others. Since having a bad record and being respected by others are mutually exclusive and based on the premises related to James's imprisonment and bad record, we can't determine conclusively if James is respected by others. Consequently, we can't definitively conclude if James contributes to the country.

<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song.
Since Inception is a sci-fi movie (premise 6), and all sci-fi movies are movies (premise 5), then Inception is a movie.

All videos are visual (premise 3), therefore, Inception is visual.
We know from premise 1 that no songs are visual. Since Inception is visual, it cannot be a song. Thus, it is impossible for Inception to be a folk song.
