   "  Let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\n<EVALUATE>\n\nIf something is a household appliance, it sucks.\n\nLet's think step by step:\n\n1. Plungers suck (premise 1).\n2. Vacuums suck (premise 2).\n3. Vampires suck (premise 3).\n4. Space is a vacuum (premise 5).\n5. A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck (premise 6).\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that if something is a household appliance, it sucks. However, we have a contradiction in premises 3 and 6, as vampires suck but a duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that if something is a household appliance, it sucks.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n</EVALUATE>"
