Premise 2: [BG] A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.\n3. Premise 3: The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\n4. Premise 4: Fluffy is Tom's cat.\n5. Premise 5: Cats are pets.\n6. Premise 6: The Olive Garden is a managed building.\n7. Premise 7: The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\n8. Premise 8: Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n9. Premise 9: 2000$ is more than $1500.\n\nFrom Premise 8, we know that Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building (in this case, the Olive Garden) if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. Since Fluffy is Tom's cat (Premise 4) and cats are pets (Premise 5), and pets are allowed in some managed buildings (Premise 1), we can conclude that Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy in the Olive Garden.\n\nFrom Premise 8, we also know that the security deposit is no more than $1500. However, Premise 9 states that 2000$ is more than $1500, which contradicts the condition in Premise 8. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.\n\nHence, the conclusion is false."

Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude that Luke is a twin or triplet because he has siblings who are the same age.\n\nFrom premise 3, we can conclude that Luke has siblings who are the same age because he complains often about annoying siblings.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can conclude that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nFrom premise 5, we can conclude that Luke often did not live at home regularly because he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nFrom premise 4, we can conclude that Luke does not develop strong bonds with his family members because he often did not live at home regularly.\n\nFrom premise 6, we can conclude that Luke either is a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nHowever, we already know that Luke is a twin or triplet (from premise 2) and does not develop strong bonds with his family members (from premise 4). Therefore, we can conclude that Luke is a twin or triplet and does not develop strong bonds with his family members.\n\nThe conclusion states that Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings. However, we know that Luke is a twin or triplet and complains often about annoying siblings. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain."

If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\nFrom premise 5, we know that if John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon.\"\n\nFrom premise 5, we know that if John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. However, we don't know if John has at least one child.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. However, we don't know if John has a wedding that is well-attended.\n\nSince we don't know if John has at least one child or if John has a wedding that is well-attended, we can't conclude that John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain."

However, we also know that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then its survival rate is low. Therefore, we can conclude that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it is not a bile duct cancer, which is a contradiction.\n\nAdditionally, from premise 5, we know that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate. However, from premise 1, we know that if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low. Therefore, we can conclude that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it is a deadly disease and has a low survival rate, which means it is not a mild flu.\n\nIn conclusion, the conclusion \"If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu\" is false because it leads to a contradiction.",
   "<EVALUATE>\nFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\nHere's the step-by-step evaluation of the given premises and conclusion:\n\n1. If something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low.\n2. All severe cancers are deadly diseases.\n3. Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.\n4. All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\n5. No one with mild flu has a low survival rate.\n6. If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.\n\nFrom premises 2 and 3, we can conclude that Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.\n\nFrom premise 4, we can conclude that Cholangiocarcinoma is a bile duct cancer.\n\nFrom premise 6, we can conclude that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. However, from premise 2, we know that all severe cancers are deadly diseases, and from premise 1, we know that if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low. Therefore, we can conclude that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then its survival rate is low.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu.\"\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. However, we also know that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then its survival rate is low. Therefore, we can conclude that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it is not a bile duct cancer, which is a contradiction.\n\nAdditionally, from premise 5, we know that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate. However, from premise 1, we know that if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low. Therefore, we can conclude that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it is a deadly disease and has a low survival rate, which means it is not a mild flu.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu\" is false, as it leads to a contradiction and a logical inconsistency."
