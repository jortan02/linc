Since Erin is green (premise 8) and rough (premise 12), it follows that Erin is quiet (premise 10).\n\nFrom premise 11, if someone is rough then they are not cold.

Since Erin is red (premise 2), it follows that Erin is big (premise 13).\n\nFrom premise 14, if someone is cold and big then they are not quiet. Since Erin is big (premise 7) and not quiet (premise 8), it follows that Erin is not quiet (premise 14).\n\nFrom premise 15, if someone is big then they are rough. Since Erin is big (premise 7), it follows that Erin is rough (premise 15).\n\nFrom premise 16, if someone is rough then they are not cold. Since Erin is rough (premise 12), it follows that Erin is not cold (premise 16).\n\nFrom premise 1, cold, quiet people are not green. Since Erin is not cold (premise 11) and quiet (premise 8), it follows that Erin is not green (premise 1), which contradicts premise 8. Therefore, premise 8 cannot be true.\n\nFrom premise 9, if someone is big and not red then they are smart. Since Erin is big (premise 7) and not red (premise 2), it follows that Erin is smart (premise 9).\n\nFrom premise 10, if Erin is green and Erin is rough then Erin is quiet. Since Erin is green (premise 8) and rough (premise 12), it follows that Erin is quiet (premise 10).\n\nFrom premise 11, if someone is rough then they are not cold.

Since Erin is young (premise 6) and Erin is red (premise 3), Erin is smart (premise 10).\n\nHowever, from premise 4, we know that Harry is not smart. Since Erin is smart (premise 10), Erin cannot be Harry. Therefore, Erin must be either Anne or Bob. From premise 1, we know that Anne is cold. From premise 2, we know that Bob is nice. From premise 7, we know that all cold, nice things are furry. Since Anne is cold (premise 1) and Bob is nice (premise 2), Anne and Bob are furry. Since Erin is furry (premise 3), Erin cannot be Bob. Therefore, Erin must be Anne. Since Anne is cold (premise 1), Erin is cold.\n\nANSWER: True\n</EVALUATE>"
