Therefore, the conclusion \"The cow does not visit the cat\" is True.\n\nANSWER: True",
   "  <EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the cow visits the cat.\n\n1. The cat chases the cow (premise 1).\n2. The cat chases the rabbit (premise 2).\n3. The cat is nice (premise 3).\n4. The cat needs the cow (premise 5).\n5. The cat visits the rabbit (premise 6).\n6. The cow is nice (premise 7).\n7. The cow is red (premise 8).\n8. The cow needs the cat (premise 9).\n9. The cow visits the cat (premise 10).\n10. The mouse chases the cow (premise 11).\n11. The mouse chases the rabbit (premise 12).\n12. The mouse is kind (premise 13).\n13. The mouse needs the rabbit (premise 14).\n14. The rabbit chases the cow (premise 15).\n15. The rabbit needs the cow (premise 16).\n16. If something visits the cow and it is nice, then the cow chases the mouse (premise 17).\n17. If something is nice and it chases the cow, then it needs the cow (premise 18).\n18. If the rabbit is red and the rabbit visits the mouse, then the rabbit is kind (premise 19).\n19. If something chases the cow, then it visits the mouse (premise 20).\n20. If something chases the cow, then it visits the cat (premise 21).\n21. If the mouse needs the rabbit and the rabbit visits the mouse, then the rabbit is red (premise 22).\n\nBased on these premises, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\n1. The cat chases the cow (premise 1).\n2. The cat chases the rabbit (premise 2).\n3. The cat is nice (premise 3).\n4. The cat needs the cow (premise 5).\n5. The cat visits the rabbit (premise 6).\n6. The cow is nice (premise 7).\n7. The cow is red (premise 8).\n8. The cow needs the cat (premise 9).\n9. The cow visits the cat (premise 10).\n10. The mouse chases the cow (premise 11).\n11. The mouse chases the rabbit (premise 12).\n12. The mouse is kind (premise 13).\n13. The mouse needs the rabbit (premise 14).\n14. The rabbit chases the cow (premise 15).\n15. The rabbit needs the cow (premise 16).\n16. If something visits the cow and it is nice, then the cow chases the mouse (premise 17).\n17. If something is nice and it chases the cow, then it needs the cow (premise 18).\n18. If the rabbit is red and the rabbit visits the mouse, then the rabbit is kind (premise 19).\n19. If something chases the cow, then it visits the mouse (premise 20).\n20. If something chases the cow, then it visits the cat (premise 21).\n21. If the mouse needs the rabbit and the rabbit visits the mouse, then the rabbit is red (premise 22).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion: \"The cow does not visit the cat.\"\n\nBased on the premises, we know that the cat visits the cow (premise 5) and the cow visits the cat (premise 10). Therefore, we can conclude that the cow does visit the cat.\n\nANSWER: False"

If something visits the cow and the cow is kind then the cow likes the squirrel (premise 23).\n14. If something likes the cow and the cow does not like the dog then the dog is round (premise 24).\n15. If something is blue then it visits the bear (premise 25).\n16. If something is kind and it likes the dog then it sees the dog (premise 26).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion: \"The bear does not see the dog.\"\n\nBased on the premises, we know that the dog is green (premise 11) and nice (premise 12). Therefore, the dog sees the bear (premise 13). However, the dog does not visit the bear (premise 14). Therefore, the bear does not see the dog.\n\nANSWER: True"

Since blue people are round (premise 12), we can conclude that Fiona is round.\n\nFrom premise 13, if someone is red and not kind, then they are cold. Since Dave is red (premise 7) and not kind (premise 10), we can conclude that Dave is cold.\n\nFrom premise 14, if someone is round, then they are cold.
