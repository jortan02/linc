Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans. (Premise 2)\n3. Humans are mammals. (Premise 3)\n4. Mammals are animals. (Premise 4)\n5. Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on. (Premise 5)\n6. People feel tired when they get a glu. (Premise 6)\n\nBased on these premises, we can make the following chain of reasoning:\n\n1. If Monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, and the monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans, then it is possible for humans to get Monkeypox. (Logical inference)\n2. If humans can get Monkeypox, then they can experience its symptoms, including feeling tired. (Logical inference)\n3. People feel tired when they get a glu. (Premise 6)\n4. Therefore, if someone gets Monkeypox, they will feel tired. (Logical inference)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\n<CONCLUSION>\nNo one gets flu.\n</CONCLUSION>\n\nBased on the premises and our chain of reasoning, we can conclude that the statement \"No one gets flu\" is False. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nANSWER: False"
