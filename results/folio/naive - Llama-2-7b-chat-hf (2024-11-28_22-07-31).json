However, the second premise states that people either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. Since Bonnie is described as neither attending nor being engaged with school events, she does not meet the condition of the first premise and therefore cannot perform in school talent shows often.\n\nAdditionally, the fourth premise states that all inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. Bonnie is described as an inactive and disinterested member of her community, which means she satisfies the condition of the fourth premise.
