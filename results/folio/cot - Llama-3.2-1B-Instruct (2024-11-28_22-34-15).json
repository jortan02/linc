   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that Monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. This is given in the first premise.\nNext, we know that the monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans. This is stated in the second premise.\nSince humans are mammals, we can conclude that monkeys are mammals as well (premise 4).\nMoreover, mammals are animals (premise 3). Therefore, we can conclude that monkeys are animals (premise 4).\nSymptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on. However, the statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is not relevant to the symptoms of Monkeypox. It seems to be a made-up statement.\nSince there is no relation between the symptoms of Monkeypox and glu, we cannot determine conclusively if there is an animal based on the symptoms of Monkeypox.\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is no animal (premise 6).\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n</EVALUATE>",
   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\nFirst, we need to establish the definition of monkeypox and its symptoms. Monkeypox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus. The symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on.\nNext, we need to understand the definition of a mammal and its relationship to animals. Mammals are a class of warm-blooded animals that have hair or fur, and produce milk to feed their young. Animals are a subset of mammals.\nNow, let's consider the premises and conclusion. The premises state that monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans, humans are mammals, mammals are animals, symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on, and people feel tired when they get a glu.\nThe conclusion states that there is an animal.\nWe can start by analyzing the premises. We know that monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which can occur in certain animals, including humans. This implies that monkeypox is a disease that can affect animals, including humans.\nWe also know that humans are mammals, which means that they are animals. Therefore, the premise \"Humans are mammals\" is true.\nNow, let's examine the symptoms of monkeypox. The symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on. These symptoms are not specific to animals, but rather to humans. Therefore, the premise \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on\" is false.\nThe premise \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is also false, as the glu is a medication used to treat various medical conditions, but it is not a symptom of monkeypox.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the premises are true, and the conclusion is false.\n\nANSWER: False",

The premise states that symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on. The conclusion states that people feel tired when they get a flu, which implies that the flu is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n\nSince the flu is a symptom of Monkeypox, we can conclude that Monkeypox is indeed an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is an animal (Monkeypox virus) that causes an infectious disease (Monkeypox) in humans.\n\nANSWER: True",

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the relationship between being extraterrestrial and being from Mars. Since all aliens are extraterrestrial (premise 1), it implies that any alien is also from Mars (premise 2). This is because being an alien is a subset of being extraterrestrial.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion. If Marvin is not from Earth (premise 9), then Marvin cannot be from Mars (premise 2). Therefore, Marvin is not extraterrestrial (premise 1). This means Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars (premise 8).\n\nSince Marvin is not from Earth, Marvin is an extraterrestrial (premise 7).

If Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal (premise 9), then Coco Gauff must be one of the top players in the world. However, from premise 3, we know that everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. Therefore, if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, she would be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, which contradicts premise 9.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 (ANSWER: False)."

This means that Badults is a show that features actors from Pappy's.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Badults piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three. This means that Badults was broadcast on BBC Three, which is a channel that features shows that are not part of Pappy's.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that the Working title \"The Secret Dude Society\" was used for Badults.

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the relationship between the stock price and being a growth company. A growth company is one that has a high potential for long-term growth, but its stock price may fluctuate. On the other hand, a mature company is one that has a stable and consistent growth, and its stock price is typically less volatile.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that some companies are growth companies, and from premise 5, we know that all mature companies' stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. We also know that KO is a mature company's stock (premise 8).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion. The conclusion states that if KO is a growth company's stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company's stock nor is its price volatile.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that KO is a mature company's stock. Therefore, if KO is a growth company's stock, it must be a company's stock, and if its price is volatile, it must be a stock that is volatile.\n\nHowever, premise 3 states that all growth companies' stocks are volatile.

The premise \"Every rose given out on TV is on the Bachelor\" tells us that every rose given out on TV is actually on the show \"The Bachelor\". The premise \"Everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people\" tells us that the show \"The Bachelor\" is about real people's lives, which is a key characteristic of reality TV shows.

However, this contradicts the fact that all basketball players who wear large shoes wear large-sized clothes (premise 5).

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Ailton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton. This means that Ailton is also known as Ailton Silva. Therefore, Ailton Silva is Ailton.\n\nNext, we know that Ailton Silva is a football player who was loaned out to Braga. This means that Ailton Silva is not Ailton, but rather a different person who is also known as Ailton.\n\nNow, we know that Ailton Silva is a Brazillian footballer who plays for Nautico.
