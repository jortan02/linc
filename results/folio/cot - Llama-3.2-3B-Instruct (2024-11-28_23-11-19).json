The conclusion states that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nWe know from premise 5 that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.

So if Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true because if Bonnie meets either of the two conditions (being a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperoning high school dances, or neither being a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities), then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nANSWER: True\n</EVALUATE>",

If Bonnie is a performer in school talent shows, then she is a student who attends the school (premise 1) and is very engaged with school events (premise 1). If she is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, then she chaperones high school dances (premise 4) and is not a student who attends the school (premise 3). \n   However, since Bonnie is either both a student who attends the school and is very engaged with school events or neither is a student who attends the school and is very engaged with school events (premise 6), she must be a student who attends the school and is very engaged with school events.\n\n2.

However, since Bonnie is very engaged with school events, she must perform in school talent shows often (premise 1).

If Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, then she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 (premise 6).\n\nHowever, since all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal (premise 5), and Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal (not explicitly stated but can be inferred as she lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek who lost to Rafael Nadal), it is possible that Coco Gauff is a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot conclude that Coco Gauff is among the most active players in major tennis.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n</EVALUATE>"

If Harry is neither evil nor ugly, then Harry is both kind and not evil (K \u2227 \u00acE \u2227 \u00acU).\n\nNow, let's analyze the first case: if Harry is both evil and ugly, then Harry is not kind (K \u2227 \u00acE). Since Harry is a gentleman (premise 6), and all gentlemen are handsome (premise 4), Harry is handsome (H). From premise 2, if Harry is handsome, then Harry is not ugly (\u00acU \u2228 \u00acH). Since Harry is not ugly, Harry is not evil (E \u2192 U), which means Harry is not both evil and ugly.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second case: if Harry is neither evil nor ugly, then Harry is both kind and not evil (K \u2227 \u00acE \u2227 \u00acU). Since Harry is a gentleman (premise 6), and all gentlemen are handsome (premise 4), Harry is handsome (H). From premise 2, if Harry is handsome, then Harry is not ugly (\u00acU \u2228 \u00acH). Since Harry is not ugly, Harry is not evil (E \u2192 U), which means Harry is not both evil and ugly.\n\nIn both cases, we can conclude that Harry is not both evil and ugly.\n\nFrom premise 1, if Harry is not evil, then Harry is kind (K \u2227 \u00acE).\n\nFrom premise 5, if Harry is a gentleman, then Harry is a CEO (C \u2192 K).\n\nFrom premise 6, Harry is a gentleman (H).\n\nFrom the above steps, we can conclude that Harry is both kind and a CEO.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"If Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly, then Harry is neither kind nor a CEO.\"\n\nWe have shown that if Harry is neither evil nor ugly, then Harry is both kind and a CEO. Therefore, if Harry is neither evil nor ugly, then Harry is both kind and a CEO, which means Harry is not neither kind nor a CEO.\n\nANSWER: False",

Therefore, if Luke has siblings who are the same age, then he is a twin or triplet. From premise 1, if people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. Therefore, if Luke is a twin or triplet, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nFrom premise 5, if people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly. Therefore, if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often did not live at home regularly.\n\nFrom premise 4, if people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members. Therefore, if Luke often did not live at home regularly, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members.\n\nNow, combining the information above, we know that if Luke is a twin or triplet, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, and if he often did not live at home regularly, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members. However, we also know that if Luke is a twin or triplet, then he develops strong bonds with his family members (premise 6), which contradicts the fact that he does not develop strong bonds with his family members (premise 4).\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left for Luke is that he neither is a twin nor triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members. From premise 3, if people have siblings who are the same age, then they complain often about annoying siblings. Therefore, if Luke does not develop strong bonds with his family members, then he has siblings who are the same age, and consequently, he complains often about annoying siblings.\n\nANSWER: True\n</EVALUATE>",

   "<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\n\nFrom premise 2, if someone studies, then they are a student. From premise 1, all students are humans, so if someone studies, then they are humans. Therefore, if Rose studies, then she is a human.\n\nFrom premise 6, Rose is either young or a student. If Rose is young, then from premise 4, she cannot be a teacher. Since no young person teaches (premise 5), if Rose is young, she cannot teach. However, if Rose is a student, then she is a human (premise 1), and as discussed, if she studies, then she is a human. So, if Rose is a student, then she is a human.\n\nFrom premise 3, a person either studies or teaches. Since no young person teaches (premise 5), Rose must study. If Rose studies, then she is a student (premise 2), and therefore, she is a human.\n\nFrom premise 7, Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager. Since a person either studies or teaches (premise 3), Jerry must study. If Jerry studies, then he is a student (premise 2), and therefore, he is a human.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion.

Therefore, if Remy does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then Remy goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon.\n\nFrom premise 7, Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nCombining premises 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, we can conclude that if Remy either owns a large desktop monitor at home or has a fully stocked and impressive home office, then Remy either works regularly and often at home or visits the office supply store regularly, and if Remy works regularly and often at home or visits the office supply store regularly, then Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor visits the office supply store regularly.\n\nTherefore, if Remy either owns a large desktop monitor at home or has a fully stocked and impressive home office, then Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor visits the office supply store regularly.\n\nHowever, from premise 6, Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or visits the office supply store regularly. Therefore, if Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or visits the office supply store regularly, then Remy either does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor visits the office supply store regularly.\n\nTherefore, if Remy either owns a large desktop monitor at home or has a fully stocked and impressive home office, then Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor visits the office supply store regularly.\n\nANSWER: True",
   "<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or visits the office supply store regularly, then Remy neither spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home nor has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home. From premise 1, if people own a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home. Therefore, all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office work regularly and often at home.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that all people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes. Therefore, all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office also spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that all people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly. Therefore, all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office also visit the office supply store regularly.\n\nFrom premise 6, if people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. Therefore, all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n\nFrom premise 5, we know that Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nFrom premise 7, we know that Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or visits the office supply store regularly. Therefore, we can conclude that Remy either visits the office supply store regularly and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor visits the office supply store regularly.\n\nFrom premise 6, if Remy visits the office supply store regularly, then Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. From premise 3, if Remy spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. Therefore, from premise 5, Remy either visits the office supply store regularly and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor visits the office supply store regularly. This is a tautology, and we can't determine conclusively which option is true.\n\nTherefore, we can't determine conclusively if Remy visits the office supply store regularly and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or if Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor visits the office supply store regularly. We can't determine conclusively if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n</EVALUATE>",

This statement seems to be a contradiction, but we'll try to resolve it.\n\nIf colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then its survival rate should be low (premise 1). However, premise 6 states that if the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.

Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum, not the bile ducts.\n\nTherefore, colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer, but it can be a type of cancer that is classified as severe (premise 2).

We want to evaluate if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low.\n\nFrom premise 2, all severe cancers are deadly diseases.\n\nFrom premise 3, bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.\n\nFrom premise 4, all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\n\nFrom premise 5, no one with mild flu has a low survival rate.\n\nFrom premise 6, if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.\n\nWe want to evaluate the conclusion: If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nFrom premise 2, all severe cancers are deadly diseases. Since Cholangiocarcinoma is a severe cancer (premise 3), Cholangiocarcinoma is a deadly disease (by modus ponens from premise 2 and premise 3).\n\nFrom premise 1, if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low. Since Cholangiocarcinoma is a deadly disease (by the previous step), Cholangiocarcinoma's survival rate is low (by modus ponens from premise 1 and the previous step).\n\nFrom premise 6, if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. Since Cholangiocarcinoma is a bile duct cancer (premise 4) and its survival rate is low (by the previous step), then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer (by modus tollens from premise 6 and the previous steps).\n\nFrom premise 4, all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. Since Cholangiocarcinoma is a bile duct cancer (by the previous step), then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer (by modus ponens from premise 4 and the previous step).\n\nThe conclusion states that if colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma. However, we have shown that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it is not a bile duct cancer (by modus tollens from premise 6 and the previous steps). This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n</EVALUATE>"
