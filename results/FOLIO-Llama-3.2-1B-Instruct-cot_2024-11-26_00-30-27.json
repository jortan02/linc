   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if 1984 is a streaming service.\nSince 1984 is a hardcover book (premise 1), and all hardcover books are printed texts (premise 2), then 1984 is a printed text.\nAll streaming services are digital (premise 3), therefore, 1984 is a digital media.\nHowever, premise 4 states that no digital media are analog. Since 1984 is both a printed and digital media, it cannot be analog.\nTherefore, we can conclude that 1984 is not a streaming service.\nANSWER: True"
