From premise 11, we know that a nice person is inevitably round as well. From premise 12, we know that young and red people look round. Since Alan is nice (premise 1) and young and red people look round (premise 12), we can conclude that Alan is round.\n\nHowever, from premise 5, we know that Gary is green and round. From premise 10, we know that when someone is green and round, they can be rough but kind. This means that being green and round does not necessarily imply that someone is nice. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alan is not green based on the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Alan is not green\" is uncertain.\n\n</EVALUATE>",

If the bear chases the lion, then the lion does not chase the bear (from \"If something chases the lion then the lion does not chase the bear\").

However, we cannot deduce that the bear chases the lion. In fact, from the premises, we can deduce that if something chases the lion, then the lion does not chase the bear (from \"If something chases the lion then the lion does not chase the bear\"). Since the lion chases the bear, it means that the bear does not chase the lion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The bear does not chase the lion\" follows from the premises, and the answer is True."

Cold and red people are always kind to others.\n7. If you know someone who is nice, green, and big, you know a young person.\n8. A person who is cold and red and blue is big.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that Fred is cold and red. From premise 6, we know that cold and red people are always kind to others. Therefore, Fred is kind.\n\nFrom premise 3, we also know that Fred is round. From premise 2, we know that Eric is round and rough. From premise 5, we know that when green, young, and round fits a person, you'll see that rough will also fit. However, we do not know if Fred is green or young.\n\nFrom premise 7, we know that if you know someone who is nice, green, and big, you know a young person. However, we do not know if Fred is big.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that folks who are rough and tumble yet gentle and kind are blue. However, we do not know if Fred is blue.\n\nFrom premise 8, we know that a person who is cold and red and blue is big. However, we do not know if Fred is blue.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine if Fred is blue or not, we cannot conclude that Fred is not blue.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Fred is not blue\" is uncertain.\n\n</EVALUATE>"

   "<EVALUATE>\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. Alan is nice (from \"That guy Alan sure is nice.\")\n2. Young people who are rough and round are kind (from \"If you run across a young person with rough skin and a round figure, you can count on them being kind.\")\n3. Young people who are rough are red (from \"Even though young people are rough, they are still very red.\")\n4. Big people who are blue and red are afflicted with rough skin (from \"Big people who are blue and red are afflicted with rough skin.\")\n5. A young person who is big and rough is also usually round (from \"A young person who is big and rough and big is also usually round.\")\n6. People who are round and green while being cold are also red (from \"People who are round and green while being cold are also red.\")\n7. Rough, cold people are blue (from \"Rough, cold people are blue.\")\n8. When you meet someone who is nice and kind, they wont feel blue (from \"When you meet someone who is nice and kind, they wont feel blue.\")\n9. Bob is cold but nice with red hair and dresses green (from \"Bob is cold but nice with red hair and dresses green.\")\n10. Young Dave here is always rough but nice and yes he is big (from \"Young Dave here is always rough but nice and yes he is big.\")\n11. Eric seems to be round (from \"Eric seems to be round.\")\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"Alan is not big.\"\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that Alan is nice. From premise 8, we know that when you meet someone who is nice and kind, they wont feel blue. This implies that Alan is not blue.\n\nFrom premise 7, we know that rough, cold people are blue. This implies that Alan is not rough and cold.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that young people who are rough are red. This implies that Alan is not young and rough.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that big people who are blue and red are afflicted with rough skin. This implies that Alan is not big and blue and red.\n\nFrom premise 5, we know that a young person who is big and rough is also usually round. This implies that Alan is not young and big and rough.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that people who are round and green while being cold are also red. This implies that Alan is not round and green and cold.\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that Bob is cold but nice with red hair and dresses green. This implies that Bob is not big.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that Young Dave here is always rough but nice and yes he is big. This implies that Young Dave is not Alan.\n\nFrom premise 11, we know that Eric seems to be round. This implies that Eric is not Alan.\n\nHowever, we cannot deduce that Alan is not big from the premises. We can only deduce that Alan is not big and blue and red, not young and big and rough, not round and green and cold, etc. But we cannot conclude that Alan is not big.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Alan is not big\" is Uncertain.\n\n</EVALUATE>"
