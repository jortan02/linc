Since the mouse visits the rabbit (premise 14), the mouse does not like the rabbit (premise 13).\nFrom premise 15, if something visits the rabbit then the rabbit visits the cat. Since the mouse visits the rabbit (premise 14), the rabbit visits the cat (premise 15).\nFrom premise 16, the rabbit likes the mouse. Since the rabbit visits the cat (premise 15) and the rabbit is round (premise 9), and the cat is kind (premise 10), the rabbit must not like the cat (by the chain of thought above).

Since Fiona is big, and big things are rough, Fiona must be round. Since Anne is big, and big things are rough, and all round things are smart, and Fiona is round, Anne must be round. Since Anne is big, and big things are rough, and all round things are smart, and Fiona is round, and Anne is round, Anne must be smart. Since Anne is big, and big things are rough, and all round things are smart, and Fiona is round, and Anne is round, and Anne is not smart, this is a contradiction.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that Fiona is big. From premise 5, we know that Fiona is round. From premise 3, we know that all round things are smart. From premise 2, we know that Anne is not smart. From premise 9, we know that all smart things are rough. From premise 1, we know that Anne is big. From premise 8, we know that all smart things are rough. From premise 6, we know that Fiona is big.

However, we have already established that one of the statements \"the cow chases the squirrel\" or \"the squirrel chases the cow\" must be false. If the squirrel is young, then it cannot be big.

Therefore, it is impossible for the cow to be big.\n\nFrom premise 2, the cow is blue. From premise 3, the cow is round. From premise 4, the cow is young. Therefore, we have established that the cow is blue, round, and young.\n\nFrom premise 5, the cow needs the squirrel. From premise 12, if the cow needs the squirrel and the cow is big then the cow is young. However, we have already established that it is impossible for the cow to be big.

Since Eric is big, he must be almost always young (premise 8). However, we know that Eric is also blue and red, which means he is afflicted with rough skin (premise 6). But we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold (premise 9), and that a kind person who looks blue because he is is cold is usually big in stature (premise 3). This means that Eric must be kind, blue, and rough, and therefore cold.\n\nNow, from premise 7, we know that a person who is green, blue, and red in color will be round shaped. Since Eric is blue, red, and rough, we can conclude that Eric is round shaped.\n\nHowever, we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold (premise 9), and that a kind person who looks blue because he is is cold is usually big in stature (premise 3). This means that Eric must be big, blue, rough, kind, and cold.\n\nNow, let's combine all the premises. We know that Eric is big, blue, and red, which means he is almost always young (premise 8). We also know that Eric is round shaped (premise 10), but we don't know if he is young or not. However, we can conclude that Eric is not young because we know that big people who are red in color are almost always young (premise 8), and we know that Eric is blue and red, which means he is big and almost always young. But we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold (premise 9), and that a kind person who looks blue because he is is cold is usually big in stature (premise 3). This means that Eric must be kind, blue, rough, big, and cold. But we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold, which means that Eric is cold. However, we don't know if Eric is cold or not. But we do know that a person who is green, blue, and red in color will be round shaped (premise 7). Since Eric is blue, red, and rough, we can conclude that Eric is round shaped (premise 7). But we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold (premise 9), and that a kind person who looks blue because he is is cold is usually big in stature (premise 3). This means that Eric must be kind, blue, rough, big, and cold. But we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold, which means that Eric is cold. Since Eric is cold, we can conclude that Eric is not young (premise 8).\n\nHowever, we can also conclude that Eric is not young because we know that big people who are red in color are almost always young (premise 8), and we know that Eric is blue and red, which means he is big and almost always young. But we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold (premise 9), and that a kind person who looks blue because he is is cold is usually big in stature (premise 3). This means that Eric must be kind, blue, rough, big, and cold. But we also know that a person who is blue, rough, and kind is usually cold, which means that Eric is cold. Since Eric is cold, we can conclude that Eric is not young (premise 8). But we also know that Eric is round shaped (premise 10), and big people who are red in color are almost always young (premise 8). This means that Eric must be round shaped and not young. Since we know that Eric is not young, we can conclude that the conclusion is True.\n\nANSWER:"

The tiger is big (premise 9), so the tiger needs a green thing.\n\nFrom premise 11, the tiger is blue. We know from premise 10 that the tiger needs a green thing, but since the tiger is blue, it cannot be the case that the tiger needs a green thing. This is a contradiction.\n\nHowever, based on the chain of reasoning above, it appears that the tiger needs the bald eagle because it is blue. But the tiger cannot need a green thing because it is blue. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut, from premise 10, big things are green.

   "<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the tiger does not eat the lion.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the lion is rough. From premise 5, if something is rough, then it is red. Therefore, the lion is red.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the tiger chases the lion.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that if the lion eats the tiger and the lion sees the tiger, then the tiger is kind. Since we don't know if the lion eats the tiger, we can't determine if the tiger is kind.\n\nFrom premise 6, if something eats the tiger, then the tiger eats the lion. However, we don't know if the lion eats the tiger.\n\nFrom premise 7, if something sees the tiger, then the tiger does not eat the lion. Since the tiger chases the lion (premise 2), the tiger must see the lion.\n\nFrom premise 8, if something is rough, then it is red. Therefore, the lion is red.\n\nFrom premise 9, if something chases the lion, then the lion eats the tiger. Since the tiger chases the lion (premise 2), the lion must eat the tiger.\n\nFrom premise 10, if the lion is not rough, then the lion is not kind. Since the lion is rough (premise 1), the lion must be kind.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that if the lion eats the tiger and the lion sees the tiger, then the tiger is kind. Since the lion is kind (premise 11) and sees the tiger (premise 7), the tiger must be kind.\n\nHowever, we know that the tiger is kind (premise 3) and sees the lion (premise 7). We also know that if the tiger sees the lion, then the lion eats the tiger (premise 8). This creates a contradiction, as the tiger cannot both be kind and eat the lion.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the premise that the lion eats the tiger is false, which means the tiger does not eat the lion.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n</EVALUATE>",

Since the bear is nice and it chases the rabbit, the rabbit eats the mouse.\n\nFrom premise 8, we know that if the bear is rough and the bear needs the rabbit then the rabbit is green. Since the bear is nice (premise 1) and it needs the rabbit, the rabbit must be green.\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that if something is green and it chases the rabbit then the rabbit chases the tiger. Since the rabbit is green and it chases the rabbit, the rabbit chases the tiger.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if something chases the bear then the bear eats the rabbit. Since the rabbit chases the tiger, the bear eats the rabbit.\n\nFrom premise 11, we know that if something eats the tiger then it chases the bear. Since the mouse eats the tiger, the mouse chases the bear.\n\nFrom premise 12, we know that if something chases the bear then the bear eats the rabbit. Since the mouse chases the bear, the bear eats the rabbit.\n\nHowever, we know from premise 4 that if something chases the bear then the bear eats the rabbit. This means that the mouse cannot chase the bear.\n\nTherefore, the only thing that can chase the tiger is the rabbit. But we know that the rabbit chases the tiger, so it must be the case that the tiger chases the tiger.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n</EVALUATE>"

We want to evaluate if Fiona is not green.\n\nFrom premise 1, Fiona is green.\n\nFrom premise 2, if Fiona is kind, then Fiona is young.\n\nFrom premise 3, all big people are not green. This means that if Fiona is big, then Fiona is not green.\n\nFrom premise 4, if someone is big and not red, then they are green. This means that if Fiona is big and not red, then Fiona is green.\n\nFrom premise 5, all green people are rough. This means that Fiona is rough.\n\nFrom premise 6, rough people are kind. This means that Fiona is kind.\n\nFrom premise 7, if someone is young, then they are kind. This means that Fiona is young.\n\nFrom premise 8, if someone is red and young, then they are not big. This means that Fiona is not big.\n\nFrom premise 9, cold people are kind. This means that Fiona is cold.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of properties Fiona can have:\n\n- Fiona can be big and red (premise 8), but this is impossible because Fiona is cold (premise 9), and being red and cold is mutually exclusive.\n- Fiona can be big and not red (premise 4), but this is also impossible because Fiona is cold (premise 9), and being big and cold is mutually exclusive.\n- Fiona can be not big (premise 3), and this is possible.\n- Fiona can be not red (premise 4), and this is possible.\n\nHowever, if Fiona is not big, then Fiona is not green (premise 3). But if Fiona is not big, then Fiona can be not red (premise 4), and if Fiona is not red, then Fiona is green (premise 4). \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Fiona is not green if and only if Fiona is not big.\n\nFrom premise 2, if Fiona is kind, then Fiona is young. But if Fiona is not big, then Fiona is not green. However, we cannot determine conclusively if Fiona is kind or not.\n\nSince we cannot determine conclusively if Fiona is kind or not, we cannot determine conclusively if Fiona is not green.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n</EVALUATE>",

Therefore, Fiona cannot be cold.\n\nFrom premise 2, if Fiona is kind, then Fiona is young.

We also know that if someone is big and quiet, then they are green (premise 8). Since Erin is big (premise 6), we can conclude that Erin is quiet (because if Erin were not quiet, then Erin would be green, which would mean that Erin is not cold, and Erin is big, and Erin is not red, so Erin is smart, which is what we want to conclude, but that's not possible).\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that if Erin is green and Erin is rough, then Erin is quiet. Since Erin is big (premise 6) and Erin is not red (because Erin is not green, which is what we concluded earlier), then Erin is not red. Therefore, Erin is not red, so Erin is smart (premise 5).\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if someone is cold and big, then they are not quiet.

We concluded earlier that Erin is not smart, but we also concluded that Erin is smart.

   "<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Gary is not red.\nFrom premise 9, if someone is round and not white, then they are not blue. However, premise 12 states that blue, white people are young, and since Gary is not white (premise 10), Gary is not blue. This means Gary is not round (premise 12), so premise 9 does not apply to Gary.\nFrom premise 11, if someone is white and red, then they are blue. Since Gary is not white (premise 10), Gary cannot be blue, so Gary cannot be red.\nFrom premise 8, if someone is round and not red, then they are young. Since Gary is not red (premise 11) and Gary is not round (premise 12), we cannot determine if Gary is young.\nFrom premise 7, rough people are round. Since Gary is rough (premise 10), Gary must be round (premise 7).\nFrom premise 6, if someone is round and not blue, then they are young. Since Gary is round (premise 7) and not blue (premise 12), Gary must be young (premise 6).\nFrom premise 5, if someone is red, then they are quiet. Since Gary is not red (premise 11), we cannot determine if Gary is quiet.\nFrom premise 4, if someone is blue, then they are quiet. Since Gary is not blue (premise 12), we cannot determine if Gary is quiet.\nFrom premise 3, if someone is white and red, then they are blue. Since Gary is not white (premise 10), we cannot determine if Gary is blue.\nFrom premise 2, all round people are red. Since Gary is round (premise 7), Gary must be red (premise 2).\nFrom premise 1, if someone is red, then they are blue. Since Gary is red (premise 2), Gary must be blue (premise 1).\nSince Gary is blue (premise 1), Gary is young (premise 12).\nSince Gary is blue (premise 1), Gary is not red (premise 11).\nTherefore, based on these premises, Gary is not red.\nANSWER: True\n</EVALUATE>"

Therefore, the lion cannot like the cat, because if it did, the dog would chase the lion, which contradicts premise 3.\n\nFrom premise 13, if someone likes the lion and the lion likes the cat, then they chase the dog. However, we know the cat chases the lion, and from premise 6, if someone chases the lion, then they like the dog. Therefore, the cat likes the lion.\n\nANSWER: True\n</EVALUATE>",
   "<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate if the cat likes the lion.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that if the dog likes the lion, then they chase the dog. But from premise 7, we know that if the dog does not like the lion, then the lion is red. Since we don't know if the dog likes the lion, we can't determine the color of the lion.\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that if the lion likes the cat, then the cat likes the lion. But from premise 1, we know that the cat is round. From premise 8, we know that if someone is round, then they chase the lion. Therefore, the cat chases the lion.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that if the lion chases the dog, then the dog likes the lion. But from premise 7, we know that if the dog does not like the lion, then the lion is red. Since we don't know if the dog likes the lion, we can't determine the color of the lion.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if someone likes the lion, then they eat the lion. But from premise 9, we know that if someone likes the lion and the lion likes the cat, then they chase the dog. This creates a cycle, and we can't determine the relationships between the cat, lion, and dog.\n\nHowever, we can try to find a way to resolve this cycle.

From premise 9, we know that if someone likes the lion and the lion likes the cat, then they chase the dog. Since the cat chases the lion, then the dog is chased by the cat. Therefore, the cat does not like the dog.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the dog does not like the cat. From premise 10, we know that if someone likes the lion, then they eat the lion. But from premise 4, we know that the dog eats the cat. Therefore, the dog does not like the lion.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if someone likes the lion, then they eat the lion. But from premise 4, we know that the dog eats the cat. Therefore, the dog does not like the lion.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if someone likes the lion, then they eat the lion. But from premise 4, we know that the dog eats the cat. Therefore, the dog does not like the lion.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if someone likes the lion, then they eat the lion. But from premise 4, we know that the dog eats the cat. Therefore, the dog does not like the lion.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if someone likes the lion, then they eat the lion. But from premise 4, we know that the dog eats the cat. Therefore, the dog does not like the lion.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if someone likes the lion, then they eat the lion.

   "<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Erin is green.\n\nFrom premise 1, Bob is blue. From premise 2, Bob is green. This implies that Bob is both blue and green, so according to premise 7, Bob is round.\n\nFrom premise 6, Erin is not blue. From premise 8, Erin is green. This implies that Erin is not blue and Erin is green.\n\nFrom premise 9, Erin is not nice. From premise 10, if Erin is not green, then Erin is blue. But we know Erin is green (premise 8), so Erin is not blue (premise 6). This means Erin is not blue and Erin is green, which implies Erin is round (premise 7).\n\nFrom premise 11, if someone is green and round, then they are not cold. Since Erin is green and round (from the previous steps), Erin is not cold.\n\nFrom premise 12, if someone is blue and not cold, then they are nice. Since Bob is blue and round (from the first step), and we know that being blue and round implies not being cold (from premise 11), Bob is not cold. Therefore, Bob is nice (premise 13).\n\nFrom premise 14, if Erin is nice, then Erin is not smart. But we know Bob is nice (from the previous steps), so Erin cannot be nice (premise 14).\n\nFrom premise 15, if Erin is red, then Erin is smart. But we know Erin is not blue (premise 6), and from premise 16, if someone is red, then they are not blue. Therefore, Erin is not red (because Erin is blue, premise 6).\n\nFrom premise 17, Gary is smart. Since Gary is not green (premise 5) and Gary is not blue (premise 6), and from premise 1, no songs are visual, we can't determine if Gary is a visual or not. However, we can't conclude anything about Erin being smart or not smart from the given premises.\n\nFrom premise 18, if someone is green and blue, then they are round. Since Erin is green (premise 8) and blue (premise 6), Erin is round.\n\nFrom premise 19, if someone is green and round, then they are not cold. Since Erin is green and round (from the previous steps), Erin is not cold.\n\nFrom premise 20, if someone is blue and not cold, then they are nice. Since Bob is blue (premise 1) and not cold (from premise 19), Bob is nice (premise 13).\n\nFrom premise 21, if Erin is nice, then Erin is not smart. Since Erin is not nice (premise 9), Erin is smart (premise 22).\n\nFrom premise 23, if Erin is red, then Erin is smart. Since Erin is not red (premise 15), Erin is not smart (premise 23).\n\nFrom premise 24, Gary is smart. Since Gary is not green (premise 5) and not blue (premise 6), and from premise 25, if someone is green and blue, then they are round, we can't determine if Gary is green and blue or not. However, since Gary is smart (premise 17), we can't determine if Gary is round or not.\n\nFrom premise 26, if someone is green and round, then they are not cold. Since Erin is green and round (from the previous steps), Erin is not cold.\n\nFrom premise 27, if someone is blue and not cold, then they are nice. Since Bob is blue (premise 1) and not cold (from premise 19), Bob is nice (premise 13).\n\nFrom premise 28, if Erin is nice, then Erin is not smart. Since Erin is not nice (premise 9), Erin is smart (premise 21).\n\nFrom premise 29, if Erin is red, then Erin is smart. Since Erin is not red (premise 15), Erin is not smart (premise 23).\n\nFrom premise 30, Gary is not green (premise 5) and Gary is not blue (premise 6), and from premise 31, if someone is green and blue, then they are round, we can't determine if Gary is green and blue or not. However, since Gary is smart (premise 17), we can't determine if Gary is round or not.\n\nFrom premise 32, if someone is blue and not cold, then they are nice. Since Bob is blue (premise 1) and not cold (from premise 19), Bob is nice (premise 13).\n\nFrom premise 33, if Erin is nice, then Erin is not smart. Since Erin is not nice (premise 9), Erin is smart (premise 21).\n\n",

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFrom premise 1, Anne is quiet, and from premise 4, Charlie is quiet. From premise 2, Charlie is kind, and from premise 6, Fiona is kind. Since all kind things are nice (premise 9), both Charlie and Fiona are nice. From premise 8, nice, blue things are kind, so both Charlie and Fiona are blue. From premise 7, blue things are big, so both Charlie and Fiona are big.\n\nFrom premise 5, all kind things are nice, and from premise 3, big, kind things are quiet, so both Charlie and Fiona are quiet.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion.

Since premise 2 states that the bald eagle is red, it follows that the bald eagle needs the tiger.\n\nFrom premise 3, the tiger is red. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we can conclude that the bald eagle needs the tiger because the bald eagle is red.\n\nFrom premise 6, if something needs the bald eagle, then the bald eagle visits the tiger. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we can conclude that the bald eagle visits the tiger.\n\nHowever, we also know from premise 1 that the bald eagle is green, and from premise 7, if something is green then it needs the bald eagle. This means that the bald eagle needs itself.\n\nCombining this with the previous conclusion that the bald eagle needs the tiger, we can conclude that the bald eagle needs both the tiger and itself.\n\nNow, from premise 5, if something needs the bald eagle and the bald eagle is red, then the bald eagle likes the tiger. Combining this with the previous conclusions, we can conclude that the bald eagle likes both the tiger and itself.\n\nFrom premise 8, if something visits the bald eagle, then the bald eagle visits the tiger.

We also know from premise 4 that Eric is green and cold, but we don't know anything about Dave's color or temperature.\n\nFrom premise 5, we know that every time we meet someone kind and nice, they'll be green, too. Since Dave is kind (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is green.\n\nFrom premise 7, we know that when green, young and round fits a person, you'll see that rough will also fit. Since Dave is green (premise 6), we can conclude that Dave is rough.\n\nFrom premise 8, we know that every single big person is a little green in some areas. We don't know anything about Dave's size, but we do know that he is kind (premise 1) and may be round (premise 1). If Dave is big, then he is green. However, we can't conclude that Dave is big, so we can't conclude that Dave is green.\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that when rough and kind can describe a person, then cold will describe them, too. Since Dave is kind (premise 1) and rough (premise 6), we can conclude that Dave is cold.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that a kind person will certainly be rough as well. Since Dave is kind (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is rough (premise 6).\n\nFrom premise 11, we know that nice people who feel blue often look green when ill. Since Dave is kind (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is green when ill.\n\nFrom premise 12, we know that if a person is both cold and round, that person is also someone who is red. Since Dave is cold (premise 9) and may be round (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is red.\n\nHowever, from premise 1, we know that Dave may be round, but he is also kind. We also know from premise 12 that if Dave is round and cold, then Dave is red.

However, we don't know anything about Dave's age.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if two people recieve the same points, the team which recieves more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher. Since Dave is kind (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is green (premise 5). However, we don't know anything about the points that Dave and other people recieve.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that Dave is green. From premise 5, we know that every time we meet someone kind and nice, they'll be green, too. Since Dave is kind (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is green (premise 5).\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that when rough and kind can describe a person, then cold will describe them, too. Since Dave is kind (premise 1) and rough (premise 6), we can conclude that Dave is cold (premise 9).\n\nFrom premise 11, we know that nice people who feel blue often look green when ill. Since Dave is kind (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is green when ill (premise 11).\n\nHowever, from premise 12, we know that if a person is both cold and round, that person is also someone who is red. Since Dave is cold (premise 9) and may be round (premise 1), we can conclude that Dave is red (premise 12). However, since Dave is kind (premise 1), not red, we can conclude that Dave cannot be round and cold.\n\nWe can also conclude from premise 3 that if Dave is round, then he is young.

   "<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the cow is big.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know the cow is cold.\n\nFrom premise 8, if the cow needs the dog, then the cow chases the dog. But premise 9 states that if the dog does not chase the cow, then the cow likes the dog. This implies that the cow does not need the dog.\n\nFrom premise 5, if someone needs the cow, then the cow is not young. We know from premise 1 that the cow is cold, but this does not directly tell us if the cow is young or not.\n\nFrom premise 10, if someone likes the dog, then the dog needs the cow. But premise 6 states that if the dog does not chase the cow, then the cow likes the dog. This implies that the dog does not need the cow.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know the dog is cold.\n\nFrom premise 7, if someone chases the dog and they are not green then they are nice.

We know from premise 12 that the dog chases the cow, which contradicts premise 9. However, we also know from premise 11 that the person chasing the dog is nice, which means the person chasing the dog needs the dog (premise 4). This means that the cow is not needed by the person chasing the dog.\n\nFrom premise 10, if someone likes the dog, then the dog needs the cow. We know from premise 6 that if the dog does not chase the cow, then the cow likes the dog. This implies that the dog does not need the cow.\n\nFrom premise 5, if someone is big and nice then they need the dog.
