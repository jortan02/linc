This statement is true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that Dave is nice. Dave could be nice and look green, but he could also be nice and not look green.\n\nNext, we need to evaluate the statement that Fred seems to be round.

This statement is true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the people will always be green.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the statement that most young kind people tend to be red too. This statement is true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the people will always be red.\n\nNext, we need to evaluate the statement that a person that is round and somewhat green while being nice tends to be red as well. This statement is true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the person will always be red.\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate the statement that a nice person is inevitably round as well.

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to establish what each statement means and what it implies about the relationship between the bald eagle and the dog.\n\nFrom premise 1, the bald eagle is cold.\nFrom premise 2, the bald eagle is green.\nFrom premise 3, the bald eagle is kind.\nFrom premise 4, the bald eagle is rough.\nFrom premise 5, the bald eagle is young.\nFrom premise 6, the bald eagle needs the dog.\nFrom premise 7, the bald eagle sees the dog.\nFrom premise 8, the bald eagle visits the dog.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\nFrom premise 9, the dog is cold.\nFrom premise 10, the dog is green.\nFrom premise 11, the dog is kind.\nFrom premise 12, the dog is rough.\nFrom premise 13, the dog is young.\nFrom premise 14, the dog needs the bald eagle.\nFrom premise 15, the bald eagle sees the dog.\nFrom premise 16, the bald eagle visits the dog.\n\nFrom the premises, we can conclude that the dog is cold (premise 9). Since the dog is cold, it must also be green (premise 10). Given that the dog is green and kind (premise 11), we can conclude that the dog is rough (premise 12). \n\nSince the dog is young (premise 13), we can conclude that the dog needs the bald eagle (premise 14). However, from premise 15, the bald eagle sees the dog (premise 16). This implies that the bald eagle visits the dog (premise 16).\n\nNow, let's look at the premises again and see if we can find any contradiction or inconsistency in the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 17, the dog sees the bald eagle.\nFrom premise 18, the dog visits the bald eagle.\nFrom premise 19, the dog needs the bald eagle.\nFrom premise 20, the bald eagle sees the dog.\nFrom premise 21, the bald eagle visits the dog.\n\nFrom premise 17, the dog sees the bald eagle. This means the dog is not cold (premise 9). However, the conclusion states that the dog is cold (premise 9). This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The dog is cold\" is false.\n\nANSWER: False",
   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\nWe want to evaluate if the dog is cold.\nFrom premise 1, the dog is either green or kind.\nIf the dog is green, then from premise 2, the dog is rough.

But premise 5 states that the dog sees the bald eagle if the bald eagle is rough.\nSince the dog is kind, it must see the bald eagle, which means the dog is not rough (premise 4).\nTherefore, the dog is not green (premise 1), and it must be either cold or kind.\nFrom premise 2, the dog is kind.\nSince the dog is kind, it must see the bald eagle.\nIf the dog sees the bald eagle, then it must be rough (premise 4).\nHowever, we know from premise 5 that the dog sees the bald eagle if the bald eagle is rough.\nTherefore, the dog must be cold (premise 1).\nANSWER: True"

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the premises. We have the following statements:\n- The dog chases the rabbit.\n- The rabbit eats the tiger.\n- The tiger is green.\n- If something eats the dog and the dog chases the rabbit, then it likes the tiger.\n- If something eats the dog and the dog is nice, then the dog is green.\n- If something chases the rabbit, then the rabbit is blue.\n- If something likes the dog and it likes the rabbit, then the dog is blue.\n- If something is blue, then it is cold.\n- If something chases the tiger, then the tiger is blue.\n- If something is big, it likes the tiger.\n- If something is cold and blue, it chases the tiger.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion. We want to determine if the dog is nice.\n\nFrom premise 1, if the dog chases the rabbit, then the rabbit is blue (premise 5). But premise 2 states that the rabbit eats the tiger. This means the tiger is not blue (premise 4). Therefore, the dog does not chase the rabbit.\n\nFrom premise 3, if the dog eats the tiger, then the tiger is green (premise 1). But premise 2 states that the tiger eats the rabbit. This means the rabbit is not green (premise 4). Therefore, the dog does not eat the tiger.\n\nFrom premise 5, if something eats the dog and the dog is nice, then the dog is green (premise 1).

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to evaluate the conclusion. We know that Gary is round (premise 4) and Gary is blue (premise 2), so Gary must be green (premise 3). However, Gary is not blue (premise 1), so Gary is not green. Therefore, Gary is not round, and Gary is not blue, so Gary is not blue and not red, which means Gary is not round.\n\nSecond, we need to evaluate the premise that if Anne is big then Anne is white (premise 7). We are given that Anne is big (premise 6), so we can conclude that Anne is white (premise 7).\n\nSince Anne is big, Anne is white, which means Anne is not red (premise 5). Therefore, we can conclude that Gary is not big, which means Gary is not round.\n\nSince Gary is round, Gary is green (premise 3). However, Gary is not blue, which means Gary is not green.

Since we don't know which colors Fiona is, we can't conclude that Fiona is red.\n\nNext, we know that if Gary is round, then Gary is blue. However, this is not necessarily true. Gary could be round and green, or round and white, or round and red, or round and blue, or round and yellow, or round and brown, or round and pink, or round and purple, or round and orange, or round and black, or round and gray. Since we don't know which colors Gary is, we can't conclude that Gary is blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between Gary's color and his being round. We know that round things are green, but we don't know whether Gary is green or not. Therefore, we can't conclude that Gary is round based on his color.\n\nWe also know that white things are big. However, we don't know whether Gary is big or not. Therefore, we can't conclude that Gary is big based on his color.\n\nSince we can't conclude that Gary is big or round based on his color, we can't conclude that Gary is big or round.\n\nTherefore, Gary is big and round, but we can't conclude that Gary is big or round.\n\nANSWER: False",

This creates a paradoxical situation where a green person (who is round and nice) is also red (which is often rough).\n\nNow, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n- Alan seems to be round (premise 1). However, this is not a conclusive statement, as being round does not necessarily mean being red.\n- Dave is round and big (premise 2).

This is a positive statement about being nice, but it does not provide any information about being round or red.\n- Gary is a kind person and he is also often cold (premise 4). This statement is contradictory because being kind and cold are mutually exclusive.\n- Red people are almost always rough (premise 5). This statement is also contradictory because being round and nice does not imply being red or rough.\n- A young, green person in my experience is round shaped and nice (premise 6). This statement is a bit ambiguous, but it implies that being round and nice is a characteristic of young people.\n- Interesting that all round people are cold (premise 7).

This statement is contradictory because being round and nice does not imply being rough and cold.\n- Someone who is young at heart and age are very round (premise 9). This statement is also contradictory because being young at heart does not necessarily mean being round.\n\nGiven these premises, we can conclude that being round is not a necessary condition for being nice or red.

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the given premises. We know that the cow is red (premise 1), which makes it a kind, round thing (premise 2). We also know that all young, red things are not kind (premise 3), which means the cow is not kind. Additionally, all red, rough things are round (premise 4), which means the cow is not round.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the conclusion. We are given that the cow is young (premise 7) and kind (premise 2). However, premise 6 states that all young, red things are not kind, which contradicts the fact that the cow is kind. This means that the cow cannot be young and kind simultaneously. Therefore, the conclusion \"The cow needs the cow\" is false.\n\nANSWER: False",
   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that the cow is red (premise 1). This is a given fact.\n\nNext, we know that kind, round things are not red (premise 2).

This is a logical conclusion based on the premises.\n\nNow, we know that all young, red things are not kind (premise 4). Since the cow is young, it cannot be kind, so it must be round (premise 3).\n\nWe also know that all rough things are round (premise 5). Since the cow is round, it must be a rough thing (premise 3).\n\nFinally, we know that all rough things are young (premise 6). Since the cow is round, it must be young (premise 3).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cow is round and young (premise 3), which implies that the cow is not rough (premise 3).\n\nFrom premise 7, if something is rough, then it is young. Since the cow is round and young, it must be rough (premise 3).\n\nThis means that the cow is not round and not young, which contradicts premise 3. Therefore, we can conclude that the cow is not round and not young, which implies that the cow is not round (premise 3).\n\nSince the cow is round and not round, it must be a red, rough thing (premise 5).\n\nHowever, we know from premise 8 that all rough things are round, which is a logical contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cow needs the cow (premise 9).\n\n</EVALUATE>"

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the relationship between the bear and the lion. From premise 5, we know that if something chases the bear, then the bear is blue. From premise 7, if something chases the lion, then the lion is big. Since we know the lion is big (premise 6), we can conclude that the bear must be big as well (premise 5).\n\nNext, we need to establish the relationship between the bear and the lion. From premise 8, if the lion sees the bear, then the bear is blue. Since we know the bear is big (premise 5), we can conclude that the bear is not blue (premise 8).\n\nNow, let's examine the relationship between the lion and the bear. From premise 9, if something visits the lion and the lion does not chase the bear, then the bear chases the lion.

Since we know the bear is red (premise 13) and the lion is not blue (premise 11), we can conclude that the lion is blue (premise 16).\n\nNow, let's examine the relationship between the bear and the lion again. From premise 17, if something visits the lion and the lion does not chase the bear, then the bear chases the lion. Since we know the bear is big (premise 5) and the lion is not big (premise 6), we can conclude that the bear does not see the lion (premise 18).

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what makes a person round and nice and kind. From premise 2, we know that a person who is round and kind is on the big side. From premise 3, we know that a person who is nice and kind is also young. Since Dave is nice and kind (premise 1), he must be young.\n\nFrom premise 2, we also know that a person who is round is also round and kind. Since Dave is round (premise 1) and nice and kind (premise 1), Dave must be round and kind.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that young people who are turning blue from being cold will be rough looking. Since Dave is young and turning blue (premise 4), Dave must be rough looking.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that when you meet someone who is nice and kind, they won't feel blue. Since Dave is nice and kind (premise 1), Dave won't feel blue.\n\nFrom premise 7, we know that a person who is both nice and rough is someone who is also big. Since Dave is rough looking (premise 4) and nice and kind (premise 1), Dave must be big.\n\nFrom premise 8, we know that kind people who are round are on the big side. Since Dave is round (premise 1) and big (premise 7), Dave must be on the big side.\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that cold and red people are always kind to others.

This is another piece of information about Gary.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that young people that are turning blue from being cold will be rough looking. This means that if a young person is turning blue, they are likely to be rough looking.\n\nFrom premise 5, we know that when you meet someone who is nice and kind, they won't feel blue. This means that if someone is nice and kind, they are not likely to be cold.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that a person that is both nice and rough is someone who is also big. This is another piece of information about Gary.\n\nFrom premise 7, we know that kind people that are round are on the big side.

This means that if Gary is cold and red, he is likely to be kind.\n\nFrom premise 9, we know that a cold blue person who is rough is also kind. This means that if Gary is rough, he is also cold and red, which makes him kind.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that when you meet someone who is nice and kind, they won't feel blue. This means that if Gary is nice and kind, he won't be cold.\n\nSince we know that Charlie is round and nice and kind, and we know that Gary is round, kind, and rough, we can conclude that Gary is rough.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.\nANSWER: True"

From premise 10, the mouse sees the tiger, and from premise 16, the mouse sees the lion. This means the mouse sees the lion and the tiger.\n\nFrom premise 6, the mouse sees the lion, and from premise 15, the mouse sees the lion. This means the mouse sees the lion and the lion is red. From premise 3, the lion is green, and from premise 20, the lion is red.

   "Let's think step by step.\n\nSince the conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence, we need to translate it into an FOL expression.\n\nThe conclusion states that Alan is not big.\n\nTo translate this into an FOL expression, we need to find the conditions under which Alan is big and then negate those conditions.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Alan is nice (premise 1), Bob is cold and red-haired, and young Dave is big (premises 2 and 3). We also know that Eric seems round (premise 4).\n\nSince Bob is cold and red-haired, and young Dave is big, and Eric seems round, we can conclude that Alan is big and round (premises 2 and 3).\n\nTherefore, the conditions under which Alan is big are: Alan is nice, Bob is cold and red-haired, young Dave is big, and Eric seems round.\n\nTo negate these conditions, we need to find the opposite of each condition.\n\nThe opposite of being nice is being bad (premise 5). The opposite of being cold and red-haired is being hot and bald (premise 6). The opposite of being big is being small (premise 5). The opposite of being round is being square (premise 4).\n\nTherefore, the conditions under which Alan is not big are: Alan is bad, Bob is hot and bald, young Dave is small, and Eric is square.\n\nTo negate these conditions, we can apply the negations to the premises.\n\nThe negation of being nice is being bad (premise 5). The negation of being cold and red-haired is being hot and bald (premise 6). The negation of being big is being small (premise 5). The negation of being round is being square (premise 4).\n\nTherefore, the conditions under which Alan is not big are: Alan is bad, Bob is hot and bald, young Dave is small, and Eric is square.\n\nNow we can translate this into an FOL expression.\n\nThe conditions under which Alan is big are: Alan is nice, Bob is cold and red-haired, young Dave is big, and Eric seems round.\n\nThe conditions under which Alan is not big are: Alan is bad, Bob is hot and bald, young Dave is small, and Eric is square.\n\nThe FOL expression for the conclusion is:\n\n\u2200x (x is nice \u2192 \u00acx is bad) \u2227 \u2203x (x is nice \u2227 x is cold \u2227 x is red-haired \u2227 x is big \u2227 x is round) \u2227 \u2200x (x is big \u2192 x is small) \u2227 \u2203x (x is bad \u2227 x is hot \u2227 x is bald \u2227 x is square)\n\nThis FOL expression states that for all x, if x is nice, then x is bad, and there exists an x that is nice, cold, red-haired, big, and round. Additionally, for all x, if x is big, then x is small. Finally, there exists an x that is bad, hot, bald, and square.\n\nANSWER: True",
   "Let's think step by step.\n\nANSWER: False\n\nWe can start by analyzing the premises. From premise 5, we know that if a person is round, they are red. From premise 4, we know that young people who are round are also big. Since young people who are round and green are also red (premise 3), we can conclude that young people who are round, green, and big are all red.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion. From premise 1, we know that rough people are blue. From premise 2, we know that big people who are blue and red are afflicted with rough skin. Since young people who are big and round are also blue and red (premise 3), we can conclude that young people who are round, green, and big are all blue.\n\nHowever, premise 6 states that young people who are round, green, and big are also round. This is a contradiction with our previous conclusion that young people who are round, green, and big are all blue. Therefore, we can conclude that Alan is not big, as he is round and green, and his skin is red.\n\nANSWER: True"

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to establish what we know about Harry. From premise 1, we know Harry is furry (premise 1).

From premise 4, we know if someone is round, they are kind. However, from premise 5, we know if someone is white, they are round. This creates a contradiction because we cannot conclude that Harry is round based on his fur color alone.\n\nNext, we need to evaluate the relationship between Harry's fur color and his being round. From premise 6, we know if someone is white and not furry, they are round. However, from premise 7, we know Harry is not white (he's furry). Therefore, we cannot conclude that Harry is round based on the information given.\n\nConsidering the premises and conclusions again, we realize that we made an incorrect assumption about the relationship between Harry's fur color and his being round.

   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we know from premise 1 that the squirrel is not blue (premise 3). From premise 4, we know that if the squirrel is blue, it is kind (premise 5). However, we know that the squirrel is not blue (premise 3), so it cannot be kind (premise 5).\n\nNext, we know from premise 5 that if the squirrel is blue and the squirrel is cold, then the squirrel is not kind (premise 6). However, we have established that the squirrel is not cold (premise 3), so this premise does not apply.\n\nWe also know from premise 2 that if the squirrel is blue and the squirrel is green, then the squirrel is cold (premise 7). However, we have established that the squirrel is not blue (premise 3), so this premise does not apply.\n\nFrom premise 8, we know that if the squirrel is cold and kind, then the squirrel is green (premise 9). However, we have established that the squirrel is not cold (premise 3), so this premise does not apply.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that if the squirrel is cold and not kind, then the squirrel is big (premise 11). However, we have established that the squirrel is not cold (premise 3), so this premise does not apply.\n\nFrom premise 12, we know that all cold people are not big (premise 13).

Since premise 7 is true and premise 6 is false, premise 7 must be false.\n\nNow, premise 8 states that if someone is kind and green, then they are blue, and premise 9 states that if the squirrel is kind and green, then it is cold. Since premise 8 is true and premise 9 is false, premise 8 must be false.\n\nSince premise 10 states that all cold people are not big, and premise 9 states that if someone is cold, then they are not big, premise 9 must be true.\n\nTherefore, premise 11 states that if someone is cold and not kind, then they are big, and premise 10 states that if someone is cold, then they are not big. Since premise 11 is true and premise 10 is false, premise 11 must be false.\n\nFinally, premise 12 states that all cold people are not big, and premise 11 states that if someone is cold and not kind, then they are big.

Therefore, if the dog is green and round, it is not big.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion \"The dog is not kind.\" From premise 5, if something is round and green, then it is blue. But if something is blue, it is not kind (premise 7).

We have:\n- The bear chases the dog (premise 1)\n- The dog is big (premise 2)\n- The dog needs the bear (premise 3)\n- If someone is cold and they do not need the bear then they do not like the bear (premise 4)\n- If someone needs the bear then the bear likes the dog (premise 5)\n- If someone likes the dog then the dog does not like the bear (premise 6)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion. We want to determine if the conclusion \"The bear chases the dog\" follows from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know the bear chases the dog.\nFrom premise 3, we know the dog needs the bear, which means the bear is required to chase the dog.\nFrom premise 2, we know the dog is big, which means the bear is required to chase the dog because of the dog's size.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know if someone is cold and they do not need the bear then they do not like the bear. However, we have no information about the bear's temperature or whether it's cold or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the bear likes the dog based on this premise alone.\n\nHowever, we do have a chain of implications from premise 5: if someone needs the bear then the bear likes the dog. Since we have established that the bear needs the dog (premise 3) and the dog is big (premise 2), we can conclude that the bear likes the dog.\n\nTherefore, from premise 5, we can conclude that the bear likes the dog. This implies that the bear chases the dog, which is our conclusion.\n\nANSWER: True",
   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFrom premise 1, the bear and the dog are both big (premise 2), and the dog needs the bear (premise 3).\nIf someone is cold and they do not need the bear (premise 4), then they do not like the bear (premise 5).\nIf someone needs the bear (premise 6), then the bear likes the dog (premise 7).\nIf someone likes the dog (premise 8), then the dog does not like the bear (premise 9).\n\nSince the dog needs the bear (premise 6), the bear likes the dog (premise 7). Therefore, the bear likes the dog (premise 8). This means the dog does not like the bear (premise 9).\n\nSince the dog does not like the bear (premise 5), the dog does not like the bear (premise 9). Therefore, the dog does not like the bear (premise 8).\n\nSince the dog does not like the bear (premise 8), the bear does not like the dog (premise 9). Therefore, the bear does not like the dog (premise 8).\n\nFrom premise 2, the dog is big (premise 1), but we know the dog does not like the bear (premise 8).\n\nSince the dog does not like the bear (premise 8), and the dog is big (premise 1), we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog (premise 8).\n\nTherefore, the bear does not like the dog (premise 8).\n\nSince the bear does not like the dog (premise 8), the bear does not like the dog (premise 9).\n\nSince the bear does not like the dog (premise 9), the bear does not like the dog (premise 8).\n\nSince the bear does not like the dog (premise 8), the bear does not like the dog (premise 9).\n\nSince the bear does not like the dog (premise 8), and the dog does not like the bear (premise 8), we can conclude that the bear chases the dog (premise 1).\n\nTherefore, the bear chases the dog (premise 1).\n\nANSWER: True",
   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the bear chases the dog.\nFrom premise 2, the dog is big, so the bear is likely to chase the dog.\nFrom premise 3, the dog needs the bear, which means the bear is likely to chase the dog.\nFrom premise 4, if someone is cold and they do not need the bear then they do not like the bear.\nSince the dog does not need the bear, the dog does not like the bear (premise 4).\nTherefore, from premise 4, we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog.\nFrom premise 5, if the bear likes the dog then the dog does not like the bear.\nSince the bear does not like the dog, the dog does not like the bear (premise 5).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog.\nFrom premise 6, if someone likes the dog then the dog does not like the bear.\nSince the bear does not like the dog, the dog does not like the bear (premise 6).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog.\nFrom premise 7, if the bear likes the dog then the dog does not like the bear.\nSince the bear does not like the dog, the dog does not like the bear (premise 7).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog.\nFrom premise 8, if someone is cold and they do not need the bear then they do not like the bear.\nSince the dog is cold, the dog does not like the bear (premise 8).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog.\nFrom premise 9, if the bear does not like the dog then the dog does not like the bear.\nSince the bear does not like the dog, the dog does not like the bear (premise 9).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the bear does not like the dog.\n</EVALUATE>",

   "Let's think step by step.\n\nANSWER: True\n\nWe want to evaluate if Alan is kind.\n\nFrom premise 1, a big fellow who is blue and sad is nice (premise 2).\nFrom premise 3, a round and cold person is nice (premise 5).\nSince Alan is both big and round, he must be nice (premise 4).\nTherefore, Alan is nice, which means he is kind.\nANSWER: True",
   "<EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, we should analyze the given premises. \nAlan is a big fellow, often blue and sad, but he is nice (premise 1). This implies that Alan has a certain disposition and is not necessarily blue and sad all the time. \nDave is still young, which explains why he is round and cold, however, most people still think Dave is nice (premise 2). This implies that Dave is not necessarily cold and round, but rather young and nice.\nThat guy Eric sure is nice (premise 3). This implies that Eric is indeed nice.\nHarry is nice and kind, though he's also rather cold (premise 4). This implies that Harry is not necessarily cold and kind, but rather nice and cold.\nYoung, red people are usually quite blue too (premise 5). This implies that young people are not necessarily blue, but rather red.\nYoung and rough people will most certainly be red (premise 6). This implies that young people are not necessarily rough, but rather red.\nIf someone has a kind disposition and looks rather round and rough then you'll find that they're actually quite young (premise 7). This implies that a person who is round and rough but has a kind disposition is actually young.\nIt's pretty typical of red, rough, and cold people to be round (premise 8). This implies that young people are not necessarily round, but rather red and rough.\nCold, young people are also certain to be rough people (premise 9). This implies that young people are not necessarily cold, but rather rough.\nIf you know someone who is nice, green, and big, you know a young person (premise 10). This implies that a person who is green and big is indeed young.\nA person who is cold and red and blue is big (premise 11). This implies that a person who is cold and red and blue is indeed big.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion. \nAlan is not kind (conclusion 1). This is the opposite of premise 1, which states that Alan is nice.\n\nANSWER: False",

Since Fiona is cold (premise 4), she is also nice (premise 3). From premise 8, all nice, round people are cold. Since Fiona is round and nice, she must be cold (premise 10). \n\nNow, from premise 10, all cold, nice people are smart. Since Fiona is smart (premise 5), she must be nice (premise 3). However, from premise 3, Fiona is not nice, which contradicts premise 10.

From these premises, it follows that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona because they received more points. This is true.\n\n### Example 3:\nFrom premise 1, all athletes are good at sports. All Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes. No scientists are good at sports. All Nobel laureates are scientists. Amy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner. If Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. From premise 1, all athletes are good at sports. All Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes (premise 1). No scientists are good at sports (premise 2). All Nobel laureates are scientists (premise 3). Amy is either good at sports or an Olympic gold medal winner. If Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. Since Amy is good at sports, she must be an Olympic gold medal winner. From premise 2, all Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes. Therefore, Amy is good at sports and an Olympic gold medal winner.

Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta (premise 5). From premise 1, if someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker (premise 4).
