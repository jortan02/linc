Therefore, the conclusion \"Harry is round\" is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain",
   "  <EVALUATE>\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Harry is round.\n\nFrom premise 2, Charlie is kind and nice and looks green.\nFrom premise 3, Fred may be round, but he is also kind.\nFrom premise 8, some cold people can be nice at times and red at other times.\nFrom premise 9, young people who are cold to others and green with envy are actually nice.\nFrom premise 10, people who are young and blue are also red.\nFrom premise 11, even though a person is big and rough when they are cold, they turn red.\nFrom premise 12, someone who is young at heart and age are very round.\nFrom premise 13, a young person with red hands is rough around the edges.\nFrom premise 14, people who are round and behave in a cold way are surely blue.\n\nBased on these premises, we can make the following inferences:\n\n* Charlie is kind and nice and looks green.\n* Fred may be round, but he is also kind.\n* Harry seems to be round.\n* Some cold people can be nice at times and red at other times.\n* Young people who are cold to others and green with envy are actually nice.\n* People who are young and blue are also red.\n* Even though a person is big and rough when they are cold, they turn red.\n* Someone who is young at heart and age are very round.\n* A young person with red hands is rough around the edges.\n* People who are round and behave in a cold way are surely blue.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\nHarry is round.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\nThe reason for this answer is that some of the premises are ambiguous or contradictory, making it difficult to determine the truth value of the conclusion. For example, premise 11 states that when a person is cold, they turn red, but premise 11 also states that young people who are cold to others and green with envy are actually nice. These two statements cannot be both true, so we cannot determine the truth value of the conclusion. Therefore, we must mark the answer as Uncertain."

The premises provide conflicting information about the tiger's shape. On one hand, premise 7 states that the rabbit is round, which suggests that the tiger may also be round. On the other hand, premise 10 states that the tiger sees the rabbit, which could imply that the tiger is not round. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the conclusion.",
